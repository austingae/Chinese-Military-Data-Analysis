The Chinese Military Data Analysis Project

Why I Picked To Analyze Data on the Chinese Military:
Both the Trump and Biden administration have labeled China as the only strategic competitor that has the capability to overturn the international order in its own image. Congress agrees with that statement, and so does most Americans. Therefore, it's crucial to understand China -- its economy, its culture, its people, its technologies, and also its military. And that's exactly why I have decided to analyze data on the Chinese military: to understand it more. 

The Most Difficult Aspect Of This Project: Preparing the Data.
Preparing the data, specifically gathering the right data sources, was difficult. The reasons for its difficulty are the following:
- Incomplete Data: For instance, for the ADIZ intrusion data, I looked at multiple data sources to find every intrusion count for each year, but this was simply not possible. I couldn't find intrusion count for some years, so I had to eventually leave those blank. 
- Data Source Not in the Correct Format: Many of the data sources were not in a CSV or Excel format. Instead, they were reports in a PDF format. Therefore, I had to manually type out the data from the PDF report into Excel. This was the case for datasets such as the ones for the Navy and Air Force. 
- Credible Data Sources: I made sure that I gathered data sources from credible organizations, such as the Federation of the American Scientists; with this high standard of credible data sources, it was much harder to find the high standard data sources.

What I Learned:
- I learned the difficulty of gathering data from various sources. In tutorials, those datasets are presented to you -- you don't need to do anything. However, in real life, such as this project, you have to find your data sources. And it is very time consuming.
- I learned more about Excel functionalities. I learned to create better data visualizations. I learned the difference between VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP. I learned how to format data with its right data type. 
- I also learned how to work with PowerPoint, teaching myself how to use animations, how to transition from one slide to another, and how to ensure that my audience would know what is important on the slides. 
- And, of course, I learned more about the Chinese military.
